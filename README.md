# Hey! Welcome to Project-Planner project! ðŸ‘‹

## Objectif :

    -Allow user to create tasks. Tasks should have a name, a description and a due date
    -Allow users to label their tasks with a status (ex: to do, doing, done)
    -Display the tasks, with their remaining time. For instance, if today is the 15th of March and the task is due for the 20th of March, display in 5 days.
    -Allow users to sort their tasks by remainining time, with the most urgent first, or by name.
    -Filter tasks (ex: only show "to do" tasks)


## Bonus :
-  Save tasks in LocalStorage, so that they persist even when the page is refreshed.
